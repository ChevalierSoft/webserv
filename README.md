http web server


## class management

#### class Parsing / bnf :
- to parse the config file
- will use the nginx config as model
- this will give the base info for Server class


#### class Server
- create a listening socket on a specific port
- listen for a connection
- accept messages
- determine if it's a correct message.
- call it's own GET/POST/DELETE (parsing + preparing the response)
- maybe will try to use the wierd abnf they provide in rfc
- respond with the right header + file or error
- execute cgi

## rnd

- no need for multi-threading for now. maybe it will be useful when multiple server configurations will have to be handled.
